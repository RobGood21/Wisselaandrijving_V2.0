# Wisselaandrijving_V2.0
My first project on GITHUB. 
I used two libraries DCC_DECODER and ACCELSTEPPER for this project I found here on GITHUB.... i hope you don't mind...
It is for use with model rail roads, and perhaps more...?
This is a sketch for arduino UNO. 
It drives three stepper motors like model 28BYJ-48
The motors and the movement can be controlled by DCC messages from a standaard DCC-central as can be bought commercial.
Mainly to be used for driving the turnouts switches of the model rail road. 
Believe me THIS IS THE MOST RELIABLE WAY TO DRIVE SWITCHES, TURNOUT ON YOUR LAYOUT YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. 
This solution will end all your misery you have with failing magnetic or servo turnout engines.
I have many more information like video and detailled explanation on my website: wwww.wisselmotor.nl 
Please feel free to use, and please send me some feedback if you have done...
If you need help for the shield PCB or other needed hardware for the arduino please contact me.
I have made a special shield for the arduino to fix and connect the needed extra components.
Please send mail to: wisselmotor.nl@gmail.com or my personal mail for availability 
Thanks for reading...
